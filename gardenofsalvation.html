                                In the first encounter of the garden of salvation raid you hunt the <div class="showimg">Consecrated Mind <img class="cmimg" src="css+img/cm.jpg"></div> .<br>
                                You will split up into two teams one called “stay-team” the other one called “go-team”.<br>
                                The stay-team is going to stay in the first room and will follow the boss, which is
                                moving around all the time.<br> He will spit out a white debuff called voltaic overflow
                                (this will also appear in the chat)<br> and these need to be picked up as fast as possible
                                otherwise your team will wipe.<br> One player can only pick up one voltaic overflow every
                                two and a half minutes and if you pick up another one in this time span, <br>you will die but
                                not wipe. At the beginning of the encounter you need to tether (not like the hunter void
                                ultimate)<br> to the dedicated closed door of this room.<br> The go-team is about to go further
                                into the second room while the stay-team is “distracting” the boss. <br>The go-team needs to
                                clear the whole room of the enemies because then an angelic (hydra) can spawn. <br>After you
                                killed the angelic the tether-box will be unlocked so you can tether to the next door.<br>
                                Once you a door got opened the boss will move the next area.<br> Now after the go-team
                                opened the second door the stay-team is going to go to the next room and the teams are
                                going to switch.<br> Go-team becomes stay-team and stay-team becomes go-team. This switch
                                will also happen after the next (third door).<br> Now at the fourth door there are instead
                                of one tether box 3 tether boxes and the door needs to get opened three times as well.<br>
                                After the last door got opened the whole team is going to chase the Consecrated Mind on
                                the last part of this encounter. <br>Finally, you are at the end of the encounter, but it is
                                not over yet. <br>The Consecrated Mind will spawn at three specific locations and create
                                those “voltaic overflows” while several cyclopes try to prevent you from picking them
                                up. <br>Also, in this encounter you will find many overload champions so bring a matching
                                weapon that can overload those champions.

                                In the second encounter you will summon the Consecrated Mind. In this section there are
                                no dedi-cated teams like in the first encounter but each member that of the fireteam has
                                his own work to do. The callouts are 1,2,3,4 and 1-2,3-4. The members that call out the
                                numbers 1 to 4 will defend a relay. A relay is a station on each corner of this
                                encounter-room. You need at least two people to tether to this relay-station. If you
                                tether to one of those relay-stations, you will get a buff called “enlightened”. This
                                buff is letting you destroy the shields of the spawning vex goblins that try to
                                sacrifice at those relays. Once three vex are sacrificed at one relay your fireteam will
                                wipe. There are several ways how your team will split up in this encounter. The one I
                                will explain is that player 1 and player 1-2 at relay 1 and player 2 and 3 will head up
                                to the left to arrive at the second encoun-ter. At each relay you need to destroy the
                                angelic to unlock the tether-station ( there are also 2 anti-barrier champions at each
                                relay except relay one) once you tethered at relay two player 2 will stay there and
                                defend it with his new buff and player 3 will head up to the third relay. While player 2
                                and 3 are going to the left side player 4 and player 3-4 will go to the right path to
                                get to the fourth relay-station. Now the players will do the same at the right side so
                                player 4 can defend it and player 3-4 will head up like player 3 to the relay 3. Once
                                both players arrived at relay 3 and killed all the enemies they can tether to the
                                tether-box with relay. So, while relay 3 gets activated the player will run out of their
                                buff which lasts 45 seconds. Now it is time to explain the function of player 1-2 and
                                3-4. They will use the vex-portals that are open between 2 activated relays. Player 1-2
                                is in charge of going to relay 1 and 2 and help the dedicated players at their relay
                                with rebuffing because you need at least 2 people to tether to the tether-box from the
                                relay-station. Player 3-4 is obviously used for rebuffing relay 3 and 4. Now after a
                                specific time and each relay got one-time angelics spawned the doors will open and
                                everyone needs to run to the middle to the last fifth relay-station. Now it is the same
                                as at the other relays kill all enemies and pretend them form sacrificing at it. After
                                three times of killing angelics the encounter is done, and you successfully summoned the
                                Consecrated Mind.

                                After you summoned the Consecrated Mind in the second encounter your team can finally
                                face it and destroy the Consecrated Mind. to summon the Consecrated Mind and start the
                                third encounter you need at least two people tethering to the middle relay-station,
                                because then the boss will directly spawn in the middle of the encounter. In this
                                encounter you will need 2 teams, one called Boss / eyes team and the other one called
                                gambit/motes team. The Boss-team will distract the boss and will follow every move the
                                boss will do in this encounter. The Consecrated Mind will randomly move around the
                                middle area of the encounter and take one of the for paths. After the boss is moving to
                                one of the four sides he will create a voltaic overflow which needs to be picked up like
                                in the first encounter, but this time the player who picks it up will be trapped there
                                by the boss and get killed if his team is not fast enough. To free the trapped player,
                                you need to shoot 3 specific eyes from the boss (6 eyes in total). Which ones you need
                                to destroy can only the trapped player see. For the players who are not trapped all 6
                                eyes will glow up red but for the player trapped there are 3 eyes glowing red, these are
                                the ones that need to be destroyed. Normally one player is standing on the left side and
                                one on the right side and the guys whose getting trapped in the middle. The player on
                                the left side will concentrate only on the two eyes on the left wing of the boss , the
                                right player on the eyes of the right wing and the trapped player on the 2 eyes at the
                                top wing. Now after you correctly destroyed all 3 eyes the trapped player is free, and
                                the boss will go in the middle again. If one player shoots the wrong eye the trapped
                                player will instantly die, but you will not wipe, so just pick him up again and go on.
                                Now we move on to the Gambit-team, this team needs to pick up motes that will spawn when
                                you kill a minotaur in the middle. One player can only hold up to 10 motes and they have
                                a specific time until you lose them, but do not worry this time will reset if u pick up
                                another mote. Once you started the encounter there will be one of those 4 relays from
                                the second encounter shine up like a beacon. This relay needs to be defended and filled
                                up with 30 motes. There are multiple ways in which style you fill the relay. One
                                strategy is that one player picks up 5 motes and directly go to the relay and bank them
                                (he will get the enlightened buff after banking one mote), so he can defend it from
                                upcoming vex enemies that try to sacrifice at the relay. If three vex sacrifice your
                                team needs to get another ten motes to the relay-station and after three vex sacrifices
                                your team will wipe. After the first player picked up his 5 motes from the minotaur
                                another player will kill the next spawning minotaurs until he has 10 motes , then he
                                will go to the relay and supersede the first player that banked 5 motes. While the
                                exchange is happening the third gambit-team player will also kill the minotaurs until he
                                has 10 motes. Now this player will move to the relay while player one of the gambit-team
                                will get back to the middle of the encounter to get 5 motes and bank them at the relay.
                                Now your relay is fulfilled with motes and the boss will get attracted by it. Once he
                                moved to the specific relay you just filled, he will open his wings with many red eyes
                                on it. You need to destroy all of them to do damage to him. Once you destroyed all eyes
                                he will begin to move backwards in the direction of the middle. You can keep doing
                                damage while he is moving in the middle but when he arrives at it your team needs to
                                start over again and do everything like in the beginning. The gambit team needs to hurry
                                up the whole time because each player of the boss-team can only pick up one voltaic
                                overflow every two and a half minutes. If you don’t one-phase the boss, there will spawn
                                another relay on one of the three sides that are left which needs to be filled with 30
                                motes again.

                                Now the real fun begins because you will face the final boss of this raid, the
                                Sanctified Mind sol nature. This encounter is like the third encounter, but you need to
                                fill two relay-stations with 30 “motes” each. The relay-station which is glowing
                                blue/white needs to be filled with the light motes and the orange/white relay needs to
                                be filled with dark motes. Those motes will spawn on their dedicated island which is in
                                the back left/right of the boss. To get on these islands you need to shoot either the
                                red crit point on the leg of the boss or the crit point on the shoulder. The leg
                                crit-point will spawn a blue portal where 2 players should jump in. the shoulder
                                crit-point will spawn an orange portal. For this encounter you need 2 teams and one
                                builder team each 2 players. After you started the encounter by shooting the floating
                                boss in the middle there will spawn an angelic that needs to be destroyed. After you
                                killed it the crit points on the boss will glow red. If they are red, it means that you
                                can open a portal. So now the blue portal got opened and the 2 players of team one
                                jumped in. They need to kill enemies on their island and collect the motes that are
                                dropping. But each time a portal gets opened the boss will remove one plate of your
                                ground (where the relays are) but that’s not a problem because for that issue we have
                                the builder team which is rebuilding those plates with tethering from the relay-station
                                to the dedicated plate-cross. The builder team needs also to keep an eye on the spawning
                                cyclopes, they will spawn after a crit point of the boss got destroyed. Now team one is
                                finished with killing all enemies and collecting their motes so you can pull them back
                                by destroying the same crit-spot again. Team 2 will use the portal that got opened by
                                pulling team one back so team 2 can get motes as well. Now after you pull team 2 back
                                your team should have the blue relay station filled up with at least 30 motes so you can
                                start doing the same strategy on the orange portal. After both relays are filled with 30
                                motes the boss will raise his hand on the ground with a blue or orange color. Now 3 of
                                your team need to tether from matchmaking color relay-station to the boss now you can do
                                damage and hopefully kill the Sanctified Mind and get your hands on a good roll of the
                                omniscient eye sniper-rifle.
