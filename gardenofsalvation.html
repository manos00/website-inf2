                                In the first encounter of the garden of salvation raid you hunt the consecrated mind.
                                You will split up into two teams one called “stay-team” the other one called “go-team”.
                                The stay-team is going to stay in the first room and will follow the boss, which is
                                moving around all the time. He will spit out a white debuff called voltaic overflow
                                (this will also appear in the chat) and these need to be picked up as fast as possible
                                otherwise your team will wipe. One player can only pick up one voltaic overflow every
                                two and a half minutes and if you pick up another one in this time span you will die but
                                not wipe. At the beginning of the encounter you need to tether (not like the hunter void
                                ultimate) to the dedicated closed door of this room. The go-team is about to go further
                                into the second room while the stay-team is “distracting” the boss. The go-team needs to
                                clear the whole room of the enemies because then an angelic (hydra) can spawn. After you
                                killed the angelic the tether-box will be unlocked so you can tether to the next door.
                                Once you a door got opened the boss will move the next area. Now after the go-team
                                opened the second door the stay-team is going to go to the next room and the teams are
                                going to switch. Go-team becomes stay-team and stay-team becomes go-team. This switch
                                will also happen after the next (third door). Now at the fourth door there are instead
                                of one tether box 3 tether boxes and the door needs to get opened three times as well.
                                After the last door got opened the whole team is going to chase the consecrated mind on
                                the last part of this encounter. Finally, you are at the end of the encounter, but it is
                                not over yet. The consecrated mind will spawn at three specific locations and create
                                those “voltaic overflows” while several cyclopes try to prevent you from picking them
                                up. Also, in this encounter you will find many overload champions so bring a matching
                                weapon that can overload those champions.
