                                Kalli, the Corrupted will be your first boss which your team is going to encounter in
                                the last wish raid. It is easy, because in the middle of the room you will find 6
                                symbols. In the outer section of the encounter you will find 9 different plates and when
                                you step on one of them the encounter starts. You are only allowed to cleanse the plates
                                with a matchmaking symbol on top of them. If u cleanse a wrong plate it is not going to
                                wipe you there will be an ogre spawning in the middle and if you are fast enough you can
                                search the right plate again , because the symbols in the middle will disappear and if
                                there is one left you can see the symbol in the middle. Now every symbol got cleansed
                                and you can go into the middle section where Kalli will spawn and you can do damage to
                                her. After a short time she will raise her hands, that a sign for you that you will go
                                under her location where she spawned there will be 6 opening door you can step in to
                                safe yourself from her wipe mechanic. Only one player can go in one of those doors
                                otherwise the door will not close after you stepped in it. There are the number of doors
                                opened like you cleansed the right plates. The plates you need to cleanse are divided
                                into 3 sections and on one of those sections you can stay on the others will kill you
                                after a short time. After you survived her wipe mechanic you can step out and deal again
                                damage to her (this will repeat until you had 3 damage phases. If you could not kill her
                                in this damage phase you can do the same with the plates again but watch out for the new
                                symbols in the middle. Now if she is dead you finally freed the techeun Kalli.

                                Now after you defeated Kalli your team needs to do the same with Shuro Chi, the
                                Corrupted. There are 3 sections on the tower you will climb up while fighting. On each
                                section there are 2 locations where you can do damage. At the first plate you need to
                                kill all enemies to see 3 crystal spawning. 3 people need to pick one crystal up and
                                jump on one of the small plates around Shuro. On the plates you can create a light beam
                                and shoot on the player on your left side. Now if you connected all 3 players together
                                around Shuro you can start with damaging her, but if you are not fast enough, she will
                                wipe you. You can easily avoid that problem and cleanse Shuro with an orb that spawns
                                from a taken captain while she is raising her hands up to wipe you. That needs to be
                                done two times on each section. To proceed to the next section, you need to enter the
                                puzzle room. There is one symbol (symbols from Shuro Chi) at each wall (in total three)
                                where specific pieces are missing. Your team needs to jump on the right plates at the
                                same time to fulfill the symbol at the wall but be careful you can only jump on one
                                plate once and you will get damage the whole time (can be easily avoided with a well of
                                radiance or blocking with a sword) once you fixed all 3 symbols you reset Shuro Chi’s
                                song which will wipe you when the timer hits zero. Now you will do the same on the
                                second section and the same at the second puzzle room and you arrive at the last section
                                at the top of her tower. Now you just need to kill her within those 2 plates and you
                                also successfully freed the techeun Shuro Chi.

                                Morgeth, the Spirekeeper will be your next boss in this raid. In the boss fight you need
                                to kill all captains that spawn otherwise you can wait there forever to go on with the
                                encounter. Morgeth will spawn many taken strengths on the encounter-room. One player can
                                only pick up 2 taken strengths otherwise you die. After the first spawn of taken
                                strengths one player with 2 taken strengths will be trapped by Morgeth. If u do not
                                cleanse him in time he is going to die, and you need to pick up 2 taken strengths again.
                                You can cleanse the trapped player by getting an orb like those from the second
                                encounter and go to the trapped player and pressing the grenade key. But be careful
                                before cleansing him and get the amount of taken strengths so if u have more than one
                                and the player also more than one you will die because you only can hold 2 taken
                                strengths. Once you started the encounter by picking up the first strength you need 2
                                cleanses within the fight and you start the damage phase by picking up the same taken
                                strength you used to start the encounter. If you cleanse somebody the one who got
                                cleansed will have 0 taken strengths and he can be the player that will cleanse the
                                second trapped player. If you do not kill him in time, he will wipe so you can stop his
                                wipe mechanic by picking up the taken strengths on his left and right of the boss.

                                In this encounter, also known as the part, where every fireteam struggles you need to
                                assign 3 player the defender role and the other 3 players will be the readers. There are
                                3 sections in this room the tree side the rock side and the stairs side. Each reader
                                needs to step on one plate and the one on the stairs side starts to describe the symbol
                                he has in the middle of his shown symbols. Now one the others need to say on which side
                                someone it has whether rocks left or right or trees left or right. If it’s on trees left
                                the plate needs to be cleansed with a ball that has the debuff Antumbra and if its right
                                Penumbra. One section will open, and a captain will spawn. Kill this captain and you
                                will get an orb that he drops. After you picked it up you should cleanse the right plate
                                whether with Antumbra or Penumbra (use the in-game chat as a reminder which plate was
                                Penumbra or Antumbra). After you cleansed all 3 plates the vault access countdown will
                                reset like the Shuro Chi song. You need to do this 3 times and you are done with the
                                vault encounter.

                                Now you will kill riven the final boss of the last wish raid. You start the encounter
                                after everyone stands on one of the six plates in the room. The strategy that every raid
                                group is using is that you are going to one phase here with sword weapons. Once you went
                                down you will go to the path that is assigned with a blue crystal. If your team reached
                                the room where the enemies are spawning, you need to look for a shadow moving in the
                                back of the room. If there is a shadow, you are fine and can stay in the room but if
                                not, you need to head back to a specific place where you will get joining allies. If u
                                joined allies you are in the first room again and you can get to your right to the side
                                which is assigned with a tree. Once riven spawned in your room you can go to her left
                                claw to do damage to her until 10% of her health is left because now she will spawn you
                                in a ascendant realm where you need to reach the top and collect the taken strength. Now
                                everyone will spawn at her final stand where you need to kill her but wait it is not
                                done yet you need to climb in her move to kill her heart as fast as possible because you
                                will get damaged over time like in the ascendant realm. If you killed her heart the
                                encounter is done and the only thing that is between you and your last loot chest is the
                                Queenswalk, the last encounter.

                                The Queenswalk is a run through the raid back to the elevator before the vault
                                encounter. But on your wait out you need to take the heart of riven with you. But every
                                16 second the carrier of the heart will get sucked into it on a specific world. After
                                one player got sucked into it, he can now pick up one taken strength in the world to
                                give the current player a reset of his timer. After time more and mor player will be in
                                this world and you need to take more taken strengths in the world. The best thing would
                                be when the first carrier will always pick up the last taken strength so the others can
                                focus on clearing all the enemies inside and outside of the heart. Once you reached the
                                elevator before the vault encounter you can slam it next to the 2 techeun statues and
                                the riven statue. The everyone will get teleported out of the heart and you hopefully
                                get the 1000 voices exotic fusion rifle which can only drop from the last chest in the
                                raid. A quick note is also that you do not stand to close to the heart player because
                                you can get sucked in as well. Also, around the heart carrier will appear a bubble where
                                you don’t get a debuff which ´kills you when it reaches 10. So, stay close to the heart
                                carrier but not too close when his timer reaches 0. The best would be if u start picking
                                up the last taken strength in the heart-world to have overall more time for the carrier.
