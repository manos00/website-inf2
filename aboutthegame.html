                    Destiny 2 (also known as Destiny 2: New Light) is a free-to-play online-only multiplayer
                    first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. It was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
                    on September 6, 2017, followed by a Microsoft Windows version released on October 24, 2017. It
                    became a free-to-play title on October 1, 2019, followed by the game's release on Google Stadia the
                    following month. It will be available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S platforms whenever
                    those platforms launch with next-gen enhancements arriving on December 8, 2020. The game was
                    published by Activision until December 31, 2018, when Bungie acquired the publishing rights to
                    the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's Destiny and its subsequent expansions. Set in a "mythic
                    science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world" environment with elements of
                    role-playing games. Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus
                    environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions,
                    PvE features three-player "strikes" and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available
                    for each planet and features public events as well as new activities not featured in the original.
                    These new activities have an emphasis on exploration of the planets and interactions with non-player
                    characters (NPCs); the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features
                    objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.

                    Players assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power
                    called Light to protect the Last City from different alien races and combat the looming threat of
                    the Darkness. Like the original Destiny, the game features expansion packs which further the story
                    and adds new content and missions. Year One of Destiny 2 featured two small expansions, Curse of
                    Osiris in December 2017 and Warmind in May 2018. A third, large expansion, Forsaken, was released in
                    September 2018, beginning Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The base game and the first three
                    expansions were packaged into Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection. An annual pass was also
                    available alongside this release, containing three premium content drops for Year Two. Year Three
                    began with the large expansion, Shadowkeep in October 2019. It is a standalone release, not
                    requiring the previous expansions to play. Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of
                    Destiny 2 called New Light, a free-to-play re-release of Destiny 2 and the first two expansions.
                    Separate seasonal passes also became available for each season's content. A fifth expansion, Beyond
                    Light, is scheduled for release in November 2020, with two more expansions, The Witch Queen and
                    Lightfall (working title), planned for release in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

                    Upon release, Destiny 2 received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game received praise
                    for its many improvements over its predecessor. The original Destiny received much criticism for its
                    story, but Destiny 2 was praised as having a "more robust story" and an actual fleshed out
                    villain. As with the original, gameplay, for the most part, was also highly praised, as well
                    as its graphics, multiplayer, and the public events. Reviews were divided on the recategorization of
                    the weapons, the Leviathan raid, Crucible mode and the newer activities like the Adventures and Lost
                    Sectors, but praise was unanimous on the exploration of the game world. Changes to PvP were welcomed
                    by some reviewers, though others were critical for the mode lacking player choice. Destiny 2 was
                    nominated for and won various awards, such as at The Game Awards 2017 and Game Critics Awards.
